PHP MySQL Basic Accounting Program for Spanish Taxes (Autonomo)

This is a basic PHP accounting system that I use to track my invoices and expenses for tax purposes in Spain
It would probably work in most european countries. 

I built it from scraps of code I had lying around from other projects and as such it isn't really optimised or designed to be shared, but if you stumble accross this project and would like to use it as the start of something for yourself, then please feel free. 

You will need to create a config.php file in the _classes directory - there is a demo file to help you.
You will also need to create an invoice template. Once again, there is a demo file to help you factura_template.html
